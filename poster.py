# ðŸ“¡ BEE JUMBLE POSTER
#
# This script uploads Bee Jumble game files to a remote FTP server.
# It is typically run after generating `jumbledbees.xml` and any
# related display files like `index.htm`.
#
# Key responsibilities:
# -------------------------------------------------------------------
# âœ… Connects to the FTP server using provided credentials.
# âœ… Uploads specified files (binary mode) to the server root.
# âœ… Displays a progress message for each file.
# âœ… Confirms success after all uploads are complete.
#
# Configuration:
# - FTP credentials are defined at the top of the script.
# - File list (`files_to_upload`) can be customized as needed.
#
# Usage:
#   python post.py
#
# Output:
#   - Files uploaded to: ftp://tii.ezv.temporary.site
#
# Dependencies:
#   - Python standard library only (no external packages required).
#
# Suggested Workflow:
#   1. Run `go.py` to generate fresh XML and HTML.
#   2. Run this script to publish your Bee Jumble updates.
